# light-mvc-php-framework
TraversyMVC is an MVC PHP lightweight  framework, created initially by Brad Traversy, I've built this framework during a Udemy course and learnt a lot about the MVC architecture and how frameworks operate in general.


# Disclamer
This framework is still an alpha stage project, so it's not advisable to use it for production projects yet, it's open source so feel free to edit it and add on it.
