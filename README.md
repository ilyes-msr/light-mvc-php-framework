# super-mvc-php-framework
TraversyMVC is an MVC PHP light weight framework, I've built this framework during a Udemy course and learnt a lot about the MVC architecture and how frameworks operate in general.


# disclamer
This framework is still an alpha project, so it's not advisable to use it for production projects yet.
